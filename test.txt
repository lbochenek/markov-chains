This paragraph is a test. Such a test. So much testing happening in this paragraph. One might think that the only purpose of this paragraph is to understand how my code works. So basically it's a test. That's what you think anyway. Humph. You'll see. Look at all the testing this paragraph accomplishes. So much testing. Maybe we should test the test. I don't know how to test the test. We'd have to test our methods of testing the test.
